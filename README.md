##### Technologies used (back end):

Ruby, Rails

PostgreSQL

Twilio API / twilio-ruby gem

##### Technologies used (front end):

Javascript, jQuery, AJAX

HTML 5 / CSS 3

Bootstrap

Handlebars

#### Notes:

Unsolved Problems: Twilio API is still a work in progress, I have a script for a
backend job, but need to continue working on implementing in it.

Go Forward Ideas:

- Include the messaging feature
- Feature that generates contact information on the fields when user clicks update button.
- Feature that uses Divs instead of Divs for handlebars.

#### User Stories:

As a user, I want to receive daily reminders of any contacts that I haven't
touched base with in a certain time frame
As a user, I want to create a list of contacts with important information about
them.
As a user, I want to be able to update my contacts if anything changes
As a user, I want to be able to store fun facts about the contact to remember
key conversation starters.
